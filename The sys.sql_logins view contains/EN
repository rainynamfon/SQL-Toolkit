SQL Server: Find Logins in SQL Server
Question:Is there a query to run in SQL Server that will return all SQL Server Logins and information about those Logins?

Answer: In SQL Server, there is a catalog view (ie: system view) called sys.sql_logins. You can run a query against this system view that returns all of the Logins that have been created in SQL Server as well as information about these Logins.

To retrieve all Logins in SQL Server, you can execute the following SQL statement:

SELECT *
FROM master.sys.sql_logins;
The sys.sql_logins view contains the following columns:
